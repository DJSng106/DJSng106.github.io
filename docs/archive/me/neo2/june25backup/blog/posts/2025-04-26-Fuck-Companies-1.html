      <p>I'm tired of the same shit.</p>
      
      <p>There is no boycotting, there is no good corporations, and there is no one fix all. I'm tired of sugar coating it, the internet is designed around people who capitalize and monetize above it's userbase's wishes. Ever wonder why twitter is still widely used by corporations? It's just the same few corporations helping each other grow, because fuck everybody else. <b>They have you by the throat. NOBODY is your friend.</b></p>
      
      <p>Just think for a minute. Think about how a big corporation and not a single solo, dedicated person is in charge of a lot of stuff you like. More notably, people who don't care. Let's read more into it!</p>
      
      <p>Hey, let's look at all the CORPORATIONS that run our internet!</p>
      
      <p>The search space is dominated by Google, a company who has done several offending things, including:<br></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Pushing out manifest v3, which has neutered adblockers, userscript extensions, etc</li>
        <li>Basically enabled the biggest internet bias / discrimination problem that nobody wants to talk about (all of chromium vs firefox). Because of a single browser.</li>
        <li>Owns the single biggest ad network (adsense / double click)</li>
        <li>Often allows malicious advertisers without (seemingly immediate) moderation that stops them before they can get to the front page. aka, infecting people looking for their favorite programs on the <b>first link</b>.</li>
        <li>Created the single biggest search engine monopoly when yahoo / ask.com basically died</li>
        <li>Basically became the first orf many to collect a lot of user data (seriously, go export your data with takeout, apparently some people have their location saved with google?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Meta? Just as bad, and also a monopoly:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Facebook division ran (aka probably enabled) the single biggest data collection scandal of the 2000s, maybe even ever (cambridge analytica)</li>
        <li>Facebook basically rewards people who steal youtube videos and reupload them to facebook's little TikTok clone feature. seriously, look up cs ghost, that stolen shit gets millions of views</li>
        <li>The Instagram division takes the cake for having the most toxic people i have ever gotten word of (mostly transphobes btw)</li>
        <li>Did I mention they want more of your data?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No, Meta Quest does not make any of the above worth it.</p>
    
    <p>Oh, how could I forget reddit too! That's surely not a problem right<br>Nope, manipulative monopoly. Spez is an infamous asshole who cut the free api apart to brick custom clients.</p>
    
    <p>Twitter? Also run by an asshole! An asshole that did a nazi salute!<br>
        They were okayish without him, the community was a shithole arguably but it wasn't bad. As soon as elon got in, <b>the platform stayed shit.</b></p>
        <p>But being nice, Twitter was always kind of shit. Elon just made sure people could happily show it imo, before it was infamous for being full of dickwads but there was good people in the rough<br><br></p>
        
        <p>Steam kind of gets a pass? they do the bare minimum to treat customers like people instead of playtoys, but don't forget we never got half life 3.<br><br></p>
        
        <p>Discord... no, lol. no pass.<br></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>They have time and time again enabled bad actors. Let's leave it at that, you'd throw up if I explained the countless servers, members and problems they've neglected while passing out bans like candy and killing RoCleaner.</li>
            <li>They also have connections with a lot of famous (and infamous) companies that basically monopolizes the kind of connections you can make to your account. Note how you can connect Spotify and Amazon Music but not Apple Music, Tidal, or even last.fm.</li>
            <li>Their official client (WHICH YOU CAN DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW.) is broken 20% of the time, every time. there is always a small chance with no warning your client will start to that ugly fucking grey and never load. in my case, ctrl + r did nothing. also, you can only use one mod at once (two if you count vencord + openasar or equicord + openasar), and kernel broke the client really hard. no thanks.</li>
            <li>Every other client is basically specially crafted to piss you off. They break every once and a while, have specific use cases almost all of the time and have no consistency across any of them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Speaking of Discord clients! Let's tear apart every single one:<br></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Vesktop only runs on Vencord. this would not be an issue if a. shelter had a bulletproof system that makes it desirable on top of Vencord / b. Vencord was not lacking features equicord was</li>
            <li>Equibop is similar to Vesktop but not even compromisable (as of 4/26/25) because it was last updated feburary. before the ui update.</li>
            <li>Dorion is amazing (edgewebview2 part is debatable) but has all of a sudden refused to do anything but boot to a solid color. Cannot even go get my settings or css stuff. I'm not starting from scratch either.<br>(other than this and performance issues it's really cool)</li>
            <li>Legcord (formerly Armcord) runs horribly slow. Tabbing out makes it slow to a crawl. Opening settings make it slow to a crawl. Typing a message makes it slow to a crawl. Looking at it wrong makes it slow to a crawl!</li>
            <li>GoofCord (yes, that's the actual name.) is similar to above but while being a sidegrade. Also less consistent, it seems to run better on some rigs while it runs terrible on my main rigs.</li>
            <li>Ripcord not only has a chance to lock you into a "enter a phone number to keep using Discord" anti-spam state, but ALSO is 4 years old, requires several community hacks/patches to keep using it, does not have screensharing / camera viewing capabilities (YMMV, I was fine using another client to stream but you might not), has aged very clearly (in a bad way) AND has no Rich Presence.</li>
            <li>AeroChat, last I heard, has terrible voice chat support and isn't worth using. Also, no Rich Presence.</li>
            <li>Discord Messenger has no Voice Chat support, and no Rich Presence.</li>
            <li>Naticord is still very early in development and has yet to show any potential. No Rich Presence.</li>
            <li>As said before, the official client only lets you load a single mod at a time, is unreliable for something that "just works" and Kernel is literally useless.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(to be continued in another part, i'm worried about a character limit stopping me)</p>
