            <p>i'm at a crossroads with my page rn</p>

            <details class="readmore">
                <summary>(18+) reveal sensitive content</summary>
                <p>The following content includes mentions of sexual themes.</p>
                    <details class="readmore">
                <summary>read anyway</summary>
                <p>the thing is, i wanted my site to be PG-13 from the start. i didn't want to mention stuff about roblox porn games and pedophiles roaming roblox and the porn developer being invited to roblox' events or anything</p>
                <p>but with how bad these issues have gotten, plus my natural instinct being to rant about these things... where can i even put these rants? i hate twitter, i hate tumblr, i worry about being restricted. i don't want to make my site strictly 18+, but i don't want to leave out these rants either. like obviously i'd not do it often, but i still need to rant and make even just one blog post about roblox's clear sex problems.</p>
                <p>so what can i do? i have a warning set up on my neocities page right now. i tried to explain as clearly as possible that i might talk about pedophiles and roblox's sexual content crisis, but i can't help but feel it's not good enough. like i need to clearly do more for this stuff.</p>
                <p>and on top of that i worry so much about platform bans. spacehey has strict moderation -- will i get banned for mirroring that kind of discussion and content? neocities has a 18+ toggle if you show pornography -- what if the rules have changed since then and i get my site completely striken down for talking about roblox having porn games hidden in the surface? what if i have to strictly be an 18+ page, even though i also want to focus on PG-13 stuff that has zero mention of sexual themes at all?</p>
                <p>fuuuck i don't know what to do. i'm so anxious, because handling this wrong is obviously very bad, but some people on the internet tend to have no remorse or no real think ahead. bad content is bad content, right? you have to get rid of it and stop it at all costs, but accidents happen. and i don't want to have to be handholded through ideas, but i don't want to fuck up royally either</p>

            <p>i restored some stuff from my old github commit archive of my site <a href="https://djsng.neocities.org/archive/">and put it in my archives</a> tonight for all of neocities to see. i made some minor changes to make everything work with relative paths (in case i need to move stuff around again) and also to remove some dead stuff. i know 100% i didn't get it all.</p>
            <p>i'm going to bed now. hopefully didn't fuck up on a masterful level doing this. i'm going to miss the fact i had some old builds i could have uploaded.</p>
            <p>I think the feburary 2022 build might be the /kore/ one in archives, actually</p>

            <p>i cannot stop thinking about a startup roblox group tried to approach me to produce for their game in summer 2023, it was a roblox backrooms thing and i think they didnt even have game prototypes yet! i made some demos, they ghosted me, and i can only assume they went defunct because i cannot find any trace of their game anywhere</p>

            <p>following up on when i posted i was anxious about using other people's fursonas and furry art as an icon -- i'm noticing a pattern of "go ahead but only my characters! please do not use a comm that's kinda disrespectful" and i still want to be safe, but my gut is basically slowly getting confirmed, i guess? still worried to do it all willy nilly, i'm always going to check in and hunt an artist's twitter page to get answers on that</p>
            <p>and still fuck pinterest. i can't tell what's commissions, what's okay art and what's outright a disallowed reupload</p>

            <p>trying to repair old friendships i made shit mistakes on... i feel like such a fool. i've dropped people for the pettiest reasons, sometimes in the influence of others i was around. i dropped a dude because somebody was gen appalled on some guy's take and instead of kindly and very clearly explain why people feel a certain way, i blocked the dude. it was a sensitive topic too so i know quite a few people would have been on my friend's side, not his. fuuuck...</p>
            <p>but i do also know that on the other side of the spectrum, i will probably try and make amends and somehow get frustrated by something else or something. i hate friendships so much they're so hard PLEASE PUT ME ON AUTOPILOT. i don't want to worry about offensive content anymore just let me yap about my music pleasee</p>
            <p>i'm a victim of lonely desperation. ama!</p>

            <p>so hesitant to use other people's furry art as my profile icon a lot of the times because i don't want to cross an artist's boundaries but i also have no idea if they would care about me using their fanart or anything as a profile picture. i blame pinterest for making it so unclear</p>
            <p>i do know that some people who make games like nami are so cool abt it because it's a game character and even some fursona owners dont mind as long as u avoid commissions (which i get -- a commissioner would flip their shit if u dont ask) but i don't want to have to overstep the boundary in the first place because i might be hard to reach or sumn</p>
            <p>and pinterest people start crediting art more often. y'all make these issues 10x worse</p>

            <p>ROBLOX strike begins again. This is getting ridiculous.</p>
            <details class="readmore">
                <summary>(18+) more details</summary>
                <p>The following content includes mentions of sexual themes.</p>
                    <details class="readmore">
                <summary>read anyway</summary>
                <p>I unfortunately cannot sugarcoat it anymore. ROBLOX is becoming a sex ring. "Moderated" is a very light term, because despite the fact I hear almost nothing about the worst of the worst, I still have to hear about how condos are still up, people are having "studio sessions", I have to see day by day avatars of people who very clearly have no pants on, people with display names that are very clearly sexual, and as I attempt to report these things, nothing happens.</p></details></details>
                <p>This is all getting super ridiculous. So it seems that in the meantime, we have to... well... Quit again.</p>
                <p>Yay...</p>

            <p>i just remembered when i said at some point around december 2024 or early 2025 (probably janurary or feburary if i had to be real) that i wanted to make one of my new year goals to be to work on my friendships and make old remedies.</p>

                <summary>read more</summary>
                <p>the first person i did that with, i dropped. and since then i've done some risky shit and tried to talk to people i shouldn't have, but i'm way better than i was when i knew some really bad people around 2022-2024!</p>
            <p>i'm making progress, i think... this is such a silly goal, trying to make amends with people. even if all i can do is just say "hi my apologies for being unnecessarily rude to you". gosh...</p>
            <p>oh yeah! if there's ever a tw, it'll be just before you click that read more button next time!</p>
