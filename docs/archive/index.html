    <h1>The Archives</h1>
    <p>Well, hello! Welcome to the archives, a place I like to call the "back" of the website, like the warehouses in stores. This page is mostly just plain old HTML because I don't care much about presentation. The archives range in varying qualities, so instead of spending time fancifying a homepage, I would just rather, well... Write the damn thing. Some of these pages are coded like shit, why should I overly present them like they're peak? They're not. They're old drafts.</p>
    <p>Everything you see here is mostly untampered aside from some changes. Some of those changes included manually fixed images (that is not 1:1 with the original code... who cares about that?), my old button replaced with my newest one (for privacy), some blanked out pages on irrelevant links, etc. A lot of stuff in the archives rot, so I tried my best to make them browsable so I could open them up to the public, for all to see what I made in the oast.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that all the domains here (with the exception of anything from NeoCities) are no longer owned by me -- <b>Please do not visit them</b>, the domains are long dead and I worry about somebody dead grabbing it just to impersonate me. And the only other alternative is to ruin the point of the archives. Oh well, a risk is a risk!</p>
    <h1>My Sites</h1>
    <p>This is the main attraction. Everything you see here is all stuff I made by hand. No artifical intelligence, no weird bullshit, just plain shitty websites I've made before. Some of the new stuff is mostly just backups, but if you go old enough, you'll enter "shitpost" territory, back when I was a shitty HTML formatter. Yeah...</p>

    <h1>Content by "Cola Man"</h1>
    <p>This content is mainly here for legacy reasons. The context of korephase.cf didn't feel it would fit if I didn't include these. With the exceptions of entries provided by the Internet Archive (IA), all of these are donated by the original site owner himself. I hope it's worth the archival effort!</p>
    <p>I have been authorized to host these. I have done my best to preserve it, but considering the sheer amount of content I am not allowed to host (including temporary files that have sensitive contents, a bunch of temporary downloads that GitHub would NOT allow me to host, files that are too big, files NeoCities doesn't like, etc), they are bound to be incomplete. I have the original files (most of them, minus some other stuff I wasn't interested in), but I'm not willing to share at this time.</p>
    <p>As I've said before, all the domains here are dead, please do not open them.</p>

    <h1>Other</h1>
    <p>This is everything that doesn't fit in anything else. Loose one-off files, old pages on IA that I owned, my old Rentry before I returned to NeoCities, etc, etc.</p>
