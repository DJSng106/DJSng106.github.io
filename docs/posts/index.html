            <p><a href="https://djsng.bearblog.dev/posts/2025/optifine-psa/">I put out a new blog post about OptiFine on Minecraft</a> for those who are not up-to-date on optimization practices, need to know why people are complaining so much or just need a good beginner launcher recommendation. I know it's not the cleanest, nor the most friendliest blog. It's all I could come up with right now. :(</p>
            <p>I hope the information is still very helpful! I'm not the person to explain in depth how OptiFine is outdated, neither to be giving people recommending stuff because my optimization tactics are kinda shit, lol.</p>

            <p>I got high for the first time last night and I genuinely don't know how to explain it to some of my friends. Like I drank a little too much and it hit me pretty hard, but that was my fault, I've been using these drinks to see if they help my sleep, but I got carried away and ended up drinking a full serving in an hour. 10mg of THC is enough to get me high, I guess!</p>
            <p>Really anxious about telling anybody yet though because I have no idea if it's even a good idea being super up and social about it. Like yeah, it was my fault, and yeah doing a lot of drugs is bad, but it was just once. How the fuck do I even open a conversation about that?</p>
            <p>Ahhhh, at least it's not alcohol. I hate the taste of beer so much.</p>

<p>Hi! I thought I should share another demo with you all. Just a little preview, on me.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a remix project with somebody I work with very closely when it comes to producing. My go-to for adding new ideas goes to them and everything, and usually they're the only one that will get a cameo on a project I'm working on. Yesterday, we had the idea of doing a remix project together on their old material (and some of mine).</p>
<p>This is one of the tracks that'll be on it. It's a remix of one of their songs, which was a remix of one of my songs. I upped the tempo a little and added back some old production that was taken out when they remixed my song. I also added some trap style drums, because that's what I do now.</p>
            <p><small>By the way! If you want to see some more, older work, <a href="https://djsng.neocities.org/archive/neo/demos">click here</a> to view it on my old site draft!</small></p>

            <p>since i played borderlands 2 last night, the computer has been idling at 50 degrees (60 degrees just browsing discord and doing super light stuff). it idled 10 degrees lower doing those things before. minecraft still runs at the same 60 degrees so maybe it's tolerable, but i really need repairs on this laptop for what it's worth</p>
            <p>anyway, i'm still playing with my wii. slapped new batteries in it and we're gold at 100% again! i'm worried about the batteries draining, apparently they still drain even while in the remote, so i've been taking them out when i'm not holding the remote or using it. a little excessive, but i do just want to be safe</p>

            <p>i need to give my physical consoles more love because i have a nintendo 64 that i love but can't buy games for (retro game buying is too expensive, my budget is quite literally $0.00 and emulation is hard without a controller), and the games i already have for it are dirty and all need to be cleaned really good.</p>
            <p>i also have a wii i just got a remote for but i have no rechargable batteries, no second remote to play with family and no nunchuck to play all the fun stuff. :(</p>

                <p>the thing is, i wanted my site to be PG-13 from the start. i didn't want to mention stuff about roblox porn games and pedophiles roaming roblox and the porn developer being invited to roblox' events or anything</p>
                <p>but with how bad these issues have gotten, plus my natural instinct being to rant about these things... where can i even put these rants? i hate twitter, i hate tumblr, i worry about being restricted. i don't want to make my site strictly 18+, but i don't want to leave out these rants either. like obviously i'd not do it often, but i still need to rant and make even just one blog post about roblox's clear sex problems.</p>
                <p>so what can i do? i have a warning set up on my neocities page right now. i tried to explain as clearly as possible that i might talk about pedophiles and roblox's sexual content crisis, but i can't help but feel it's not good enough. like i need to clearly do more for this stuff.</p>
                <p>and on top of that i worry so much about platform bans. spacehey has strict moderation -- will i get banned for mirroring that kind of discussion and content? neocities has a 18+ toggle if you show pornography -- what if the rules have changed since then and i get my site completely striken down for talking about roblox having porn games hidden in the surface? what if i have to strictly be an 18+ page, even though i also want to focus on PG-13 stuff that has zero mention of sexual themes at all?</p>
                <p>fuuuck i don't know what to do. i'm so anxious, because handling this wrong is obviously very bad, but some people on the internet tend to have no remorse or no real think ahead. bad content is bad content, right? you have to get rid of it and stop it at all costs, but accidents happen. and i don't want to have to be handholded through ideas, but i don't want to fuck up royally either</p>

            <p>i restored some stuff from my old github commit archive of my site <a href="https://djsng.neocities.org/archive/">and put it in my archives</a> tonight for all of neocities to see. i made some minor changes to make everything work with relative paths (in case i need to move stuff around again) and also to remove some dead stuff. i know 100% i didn't get it all.</p>
            <p>i'm going to bed now. hopefully didn't fuck up on a masterful level doing this. i'm going to miss the fact i had some old builds i could have uploaded.</p>
            <p>I think the feburary 2022 build might be the /kore/ one in archives, actually</p>

            <p>i cannot stop thinking about a startup roblox group tried to approach me to produce for their game in summer 2023, it was a roblox backrooms thing and i think they didnt even have game prototypes yet! i made some demos, they ghosted me, and i can only assume they went defunct because i cannot find any trace of their game anywhere</p>

            <p>following up on when i posted i was anxious about using other people's fursonas and furry art as an icon -- i'm noticing a pattern of "go ahead but only my characters! please do not use a comm that's kinda disrespectful" and i still want to be safe, but my gut is basically slowly getting confirmed, i guess? still worried to do it all willy nilly, i'm always going to check in and hunt an artist's twitter page to get answers on that</p>
            <p>and still fuck pinterest. i can't tell what's commissions, what's okay art and what's outright a disallowed reupload</p>

            <p>trying to repair old friendships i made shit mistakes on... i feel like such a fool. i've dropped people for the pettiest reasons, sometimes in the influence of others i was around. i dropped a dude because somebody was gen appalled on some guy's take and instead of kindly and very clearly explain why people feel a certain way, i blocked the dude. it was a sensitive topic too so i know quite a few people would have been on my friend's side, not his. fuuuck...</p>
            <p>but i do also know that on the other side of the spectrum, i will probably try and make amends and somehow get frustrated by something else or something. i hate friendships so much they're so hard PLEASE PUT ME ON AUTOPILOT. i don't want to worry about offensive content anymore just let me yap about my music pleasee</p>

            <p>so hesitant to use other people's furry art as my profile icon a lot of the times because i don't want to cross an artist's boundaries but i also have no idea if they would care about me using their fanart or anything as a profile picture. i blame pinterest for making it so unclear</p>
            <p>i do know that some people who make games like nami are so cool abt it because it's a game character and even some fursona owners dont mind as long as u avoid commissions (which i get -- a commissioner would flip their shit if u dont ask) but i don't want to have to overstep the boundary in the first place because i might be hard to reach or sumn</p>
            <p>and pinterest people start crediting art more often. y'all make these issues 10x worse</p>

                <p>I unfortunately cannot sugarcoat it anymore. ROBLOX is becoming a sex ring. "Moderated" is a very light term, because despite the fact I hear almost nothing about the worst of the worst, I still have to hear about how condos are still up, people are having "studio sessions", I have to see day by day avatars of people who very clearly have no pants on, people with display names that are very clearly sexual, and as I attempt to report these things, nothing happens.</p></details></details>
                <p>This is all getting super ridiculous. So it seems that in the meantime, we have to... well... Quit again.</p>
                <p>Yay...</p>

            <p>i just remembered when i said at some point around december 2024 or early 2025 (probably janurary or feburary if i had to be real) that i wanted to make one of my new year goals to be to work on my friendships and make old remedies.</p>

                <summary>read more</summary>
                <p>the first person i did that with, i dropped. and since then i've done some risky shit and tried to talk to people i shouldn't have, but i'm way better than i was when i knew some really bad people around 2022-2024!</p>
            <p>i'm making progress, i think... this is such a silly goal, trying to make amends with people. even if all i can do is just say "hi my apologies for being unnecessarily rude to you". gosh...</p>
            <p>oh yeah! if there's ever a tw, it'll be just before you click that read more button next time!</p>

            <p>I used to do a whole bunch of demo posting stuff, but I got super lazy at one point because of how hard it was... But now, I'm ready to give it another shot!</p>
            <p>As celebration for having this little tumblr thing up and running, here's a little demo I wanted to share!</p>
            <p>All I need to do is find a snippet of code that makes a nice looking audio player, rather than just the browser's default...</p>

        <!--each post should use the "article" element. set its class to "post", and add any tags that you use with spaces separating them. this is how it knows which posts to filter when you click the buttons above!-->

        i moved a bunch of stuff into comments for reference stuff. because i don't need the guide stuff until later!

            <p>i just learned that you can hide post content behind a read more, like this:</p>
            <details class="readmore">
                <summary>read more</summary>
                <img src="images/photo3.png" alt="pastille sweeping" loading="lazy">
                <p>nothing to see here!</p>

        nami's comment: you don't have to add the tag links at the bottom of the post for it to show up in the tag filters! as long as you remember to put the tag id in the article class
        dj: okay i think this shows how to do a lazy post. noted...
