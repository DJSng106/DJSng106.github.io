							Hey, welcome to Woodacadweb! You can also call this site EmoMIDIs or korephase.cf! I'm  Kore, the one behind project phoenix, the gallery, and more. I'm well known for somehow being trusted in some stuff, as well as a contributer to some of my friend's projects. A couple other possibilities that you may know me by is the guy that hosts Minecraft/Novetus, and your friend. Mostly just the phoenix guy and an ex novetus+ moderator though.
						</p>
						<p>
						if you visited this website in curiosity from my minecraft/novetus servers, or you found my website while scrolling the internet on one of my friend's pages by chance, then this may not be for you. this site is where I often make fun of things I have rants out for, as well as gags that aren't really appropiate and other random, maniacal stuff. Well uh i didn't expect you to check, because this site is mostly just for joking around. click "leave hell" on the topbar if you know me from novetus or something. also, there's music on this page, you just need to click home again and accept autoplay on your browser if it blocks it.
						<p>
						<p>
						All content you see here was created by the feedback of some friends that worked on SEVERAL inside jokes that make this site, as well as some creations I wanted to make myself. Anything that seems satire, outlandish, or even childish was most likely voted on by people I know and trust. Hope you enjoy what became this site, and I hope to continue it as long as I can. Nothing here is intended to be offending or serious, so if you have concerns or think I'm doing something I shouldn't be, I'll glady take it down.
						<p>
						<a href="credits.html">And yes, there's a credit page. I didn't forget about the credits page. It's in the More Links place at the top, but you may also click here to see them.</a>

                        There's a few new changes on the frontend side, so hopefully it's something to look forward to! Here's the full list:
						<p>
						1. Backend adjustments. There's now a dedicated folder for one-off gags, the credits page has had it's bloat removed, the icon now works properly, and the copyright screen is now more consistent.
						<p>
						<p>
						2. New page, <a href="/portswork">It tests if the site's up!</a> Or you know, just visit....
						<p>
						3. Grammar corrections.

						this also means my brother's servers work, lmfao. if some execution guy got you here, hi, it's his lame and super boring brother, either you didn't enter the right thing into minecraft or you got curious. either way, ur cool, k bye

						<p>
						for personal friends, my other carrd.co was updated, so don't forget about that

						Finally also figured out the site theme. If you like the site song, the real song is Angel of Death by Slayer.
